        <p class="aboutme-msg">My name is Emma Bloomfield, and I am from Colorado. My family now lives in Utah. I graduated from high school in 2023, and am in my second semester at BYU-Idaho. I am currently a software engineering major. I am the youngest in my family, and have 3 older siblings. I enjoy being outside, and doing activities such as hiking. I enjoy watching the sunset, and taking pictures of the beautiful outdoors. I love spending time with my friends and family, doing activities like hiking, cooking, playing music, or just talking. Music is one of my favorite things. I love listening to music, and often spend my free time listening to music. But I also love creating music. I play several instruments, including clarinet, saxophone, ukulele, and piano. I have been playing piano since the age of 8, and have been playing clarinet since I was 12. I did band all throughout middle and high school, playing in the jazz band, wind ensemble, pep band, and pit orchestra. I also was a part of many honor bands, including All-State Band and All-State Orchestra. My first semester at BYU-Idaho, I played in the University Band. Traveling is one of my passions. The amount I have traveled is small, but it is one of my goals for my future. Some of my bucket list places include France, Japan, Korea, and Australia. I have been able to go to Canada, the Bahamas, and some exciting places in the US, but am excited to explore more of the world. With traveling, I love going to concerts. I have had the opportunity to go to 3, one of them taking me to San Antonio, Texas, and another taking me to Washington, DC. I am excited to one day be able to travel a lot, especially to go to concerts of my favorite artists. My future dream career is something in Software Engineering that challenges me, and involves full-stack development. I hope to have a flexible job so that I can have the flexibility to travel, and gives me time to be around my friends and family as much as possible.</p>

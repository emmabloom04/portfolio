            <p>I am a software engineering major at BYU-Idaho in my 2nd semester, and have taken many classes to further my skills. I have written many programs in Python, having taken CSE 110 and CSE 111. Here is a link to some of my Python projects: [link]. I also know how to program in CSS and HTML, starting in WDD 130. This website is an example of my ability in CSS and HTML. I have also begun programming in C# in CSE 210, and will continue to learn more languages as I take more classes. Here is a link to my C# projects: [link]. For my previous job experience, I have worked as an assistant to a wallpaper installer. I have also worked as a server in the kitchen at an assisted living center. I also worked as a baker at Crumbl in Spanish Fork. I also have a lot of experience with community service. I have tutored many people as well, in both math and programming, in high school and at BYU-Idaho.</p>
